As described in his 1870 paper Die Untersuchungsmethode des Centralnervensystems beim Menschen, many of his methods were enormously complicated. Betz significantly improved Reil's method of brain tissue fixation with ethanol by adding ether and chloroform, potassium bichromate, and iodine. He established certain fixation solutions and methods for fixing every specific brain structure. Betz's method allowed him to cut extremely thin brain sections. He had specific instructions for cutting and invented a system that minimized friction and allowed tissue to be cut smoothly. A perfectly hardened brain permits very large and thin sections to be made. For these purposes Betz invented a special guillotine-like cutting machine (figs. below) that yielded excellent brain sections.";
